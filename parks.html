            <h2>Best parks to take your dog</h2>
            <p>Looking for the best parks to take your dog in Lisbon? We may have a small park near our house that works
                for everyday walks. However, it always feels good to vary and introduce our dog to new places and
                smells. Get to know our suggestions!</p>

                        <p>From the unavoidable Alameda Keil do Amaral, where we always have authentic dog festivals on
                            weekends, to Parque do Calhau and Mata de Benfica, Monsanto could not fail to be at the top
                            of our list of parks to take your dog in Lisbon! <br> With an area of 1000 hectares, there
                            is therefore room for everyone in the "lung" of Lisbon: both for those who love a good
                            "doggy day out" on a Saturday afternoon and for those who prefer a walk alone with their
                            dog.</p>

                        <p>In 2013, Lisbon's first dog park opened, precisely in Jardim do Campo Grande. For that reason
                            alone,
                            this park deserves a visit from your best friend. In recent years the Jardim do Campo Grande
                            has
                            been gaining a new life, having returned to be one of the best parks in Lisbon for a walk
                            with your
                            dog!</p>

                        <p>In Parque José Gomes Ferreira there are about 11 hectares, with many olive and carob trees,
                            two
                            table

                            there's
                            also a kiosk with a terrace - this is, in fact, one of the meeting points for the dogs that
                            walk
                            around Parque José Gomes Ferreira (or Mata de Alvalade, as it's known), one of the best
                            gardens
                            in Lisbon to walk your dog! In other words, safe choice!</p>
